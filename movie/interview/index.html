            <h3 id="article_title">We still visit theatre, though domestic movies suck</h3>

            <p>Chinese movie market is on its way to be the most profitable one in the world, but will this be a ‘new normal’? </p>

            <p>Eight Chinese young adults have shared their opinions, who are the main movie consumers in recent future. The good news is all of them find it necessary to visit theatre, while their opinions vary on domestic and foreign movies, censorship and rating system, and the current ecosystem of Chinese movie industry.</p>

            <h4>What does movie mean?</h4>

            <p>Generally speaking, movie means a lot to them. Some describe their feeling with poetic language, while some have clear awareness of industrial and political actions behind. </p>

            <p>May, having worked in Chengdu for a year, says that "watching movie can amplify your own emotions, such as happiness, sweetness and sorrow, and that’s why I like it". Chengdu is <a href="http://www.cbnweek.com/v/article?id=21930" target="_blank">predicted to be the next first tier city</a>. This southwest city <a href="http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5NDE1NjI2NA==&mid=202837592&idx=1&sn=34a9016a7f5841941b0518241f86e3c2#rd" target="_blank">has managed to rank 5th in total film grossing city list</a>, next to the current four first tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.</p>

            <p>For overseas student Tom, movie is a tool for gaining knowledge, because "it is straightforward and with lots of details". He has used it to learn about historical events and foreign cultures, as well as the pace of social development. While others have little interest over main-melody movies like The Founding of a Republic, he regards them as a chance to "know the ideology of our country". </p>

            <p>Molly considers movie as "an important activity for relaxation", as it helps release pressure and can improve her mood. She says sometimes she "watch outrageously" even during semester, because she needs relaxing after "a tough day of studying".</p>

            <p>After two years’ "fighting" in Beijing, Simon says now he would not watch movie at early evening, as it wastes precious time that could be spent on work. Meanwhile, he always thinks about the development of Chinese movie industry, and its potential influence on him – "does this mean movie industry will rise in China? Will more industrial parks be built? And how could this affect me? By now, all these things still seem faraway."</p>

            <h4>How do they choose movies?</h4>

            <p>Although all eight of them have watched at least 4 out of top 10 movies with highest box office records in mainland China, Avatar is the only movie that nobody missed. </p>

            <p>Does this mean they prefer Hollywood action movies with spectacle? At least the marketers of Jason Bourne think so. This movie was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37212239" target="_blank">only shown in 3D in most Chinese theatres</a> in its opening week.</p>

            <p>However, when asked about their standards for choosing movies, though blockbusters are still preferred in theatre, nobody mentions 3D as a decisive point. Instead, the story of a movie is quite important.</p>

            <p>Living in Chongqing since born, Doug admits he finds less and less movies attractive, and he mostly watches old movies online, but "if the story is related to me and has the power to touch me, I will certainly watch it. Big stars and familiar teams are not a guarantee for my money, but you can say that I tend to choose movie with these features". </p>

            <p>May agrees that there is no guarantee with the cast, as "even the greatest actor in the world could produce bad movies". She also mentions that, "I don’t like movies sensationalising their production stories behind the scene, and I consider that as moral kidnapping". </p>

            <p>Many rely on movie feedbacks for deciding which movies to watch. Simon and Ray both say they will look at reviews and watch movies with good reputation, and Alison mentions "there are scores and reviews when you use mobile application to buy tickets, so it’s very convenient".</p>

            <p>While admitting she can be attracted by a movie’s background story, Molly says she still rely on online reviews to decide whether watch it or not – "For instance, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1920885/" target="_blank">Big Fish &amp; Begonia</a> takes twelve years to produce, and I would like to watch it, but then I heard it’s not that good and I gave up."</p>

            <h4>Are theatres still necessary?</h4>

            <p>Back to the good news in the beginning, that all interviewees regard it as necessary to go to theatre for movie, even if techniques like virtual reality have had developed fast.</p>

            <p>Ray, who lives in Nanchang, explains his answer straightforwardly, that "you cannot date on your smartphone. Theatre actually offers an opportunity for dating." Tom uses "networking" to describe his experience in theatre, that he meets friends there, instead of simply watching movies.</p>

           <p>May has used a simile to express her opinion: "just like you still eat out, even if you know how to cook". Similarly, Doug compares watching movie to watching football games, that "though you can watch it on TV, lots of people go to the arena, because it’s the feeling that matters." He considers theatre as a public space, with special atmosphere that you can share with other viewers. </p>

            <p>Simon has an opposite opinion on theatre’s atmosphere, that "home is a place for relaxing with friends, but in theatre, you can act recklessly and immerse in your own world." He continues that, "when in theatre, all of your senses are taken up by movie. Seat limit, other people around, wide screen, great audio effects, all these make up an atmosphere, which is just different."</p>

            <p>"I’m pretty confident in theatre in the future, because this is a solid entertainment industry," says Molly. She thinks consumers will show their support for movies in the way of buying tickets, and "in return, theatres have more gimmicks for promoting, such as doing cosplay on premiere."</p>

            <p>Alison, who has worked for a year in Guangzhou, holds a different opinion that she has no choice but to visit theatre, because of the inadequacy of entertainment - "we Chinese own only few entertaining methods. True story."</p>

            <h4>Summer and new year holidays rule?</h4>

            <p>It has been said summer and new year holidays are important periods for movie, just as <a href="https://github.com/trekwho/hereiam/blob/gh-pages/movie/top100/list.docx" target="_blank">top 100 sold movies list</a> suggests, December has seen most listed movies be released, while October least. </p>

            <p>Almost everyone mentions summer and new year holidays as important periods for appreciating new movies, but their reasons are quite different.</p>

            <p>Some watch most movies during these periods not because of personal schedule, but the quantity of released movies. Doug says that "many new movies will be on" during these time, and Alison adds that "when new movies burst, there are relatively more good movies".</p>

            <p>Simon agrees he watches more when movies are heavily released, especially when foreign blockbusters are imported, but he argues that "it’s definitely not during summer holidays, because of the domestic film protection month". For him, the beginning of each year is the best time for moviegoers.</p>

            <p>For others, their schedule decides whether they are free for a movie. May says that she might go to theatre "everyday during holidays and festivals, if I have dates". She also takes the quantity of movies as a condition, thinking that more movies out there provide more choices.</p>

            <p>Ray says he spend plenty of time in theatre during summer holidays, and "It mainly depends on my spare time, as I won’t watch any movies if I’m busy". Tom feels the same, that by summer and winter holidays he will be free, and he’ll then often visit theatre.</p>

            <h4>Movie and politics?</h4>

            <p>Being in China makes it improbable for movie to be independent from politics, that phrases like "domestic film protection month" constantly call attention to the state’s power over movie.</p>

            <p>What the state allows people to watch in theatre can be an interesting issue, as the guidance on passing censorship made by SARFT remains vague and subjective. Mia feels that screen is full of mindless Hollywood movies, but "it is what we have observed shapes our value system, and it might be a governmental action for brainwashing". </p>

            <p>She comments that, "to be honest, SARFT is a little bitchy". </p>

            <p>Meanwhile, she finds it boring for all movies to carry the same value system, and she would like to see Chinese value system have stronger influence in the world. "China has to be economically developed before trying to export values, or it would only be in derision." Says she.</p>
             
            <p>In Doug’s opinion, movie should be independent from politics, but he admits that "this issue is very sensitive in China, therefore public figures have to pay extra attention to their behaviours". </p>

            <p>Alison believes that independent art appreciation is impossible in China, especially when president Xi come into power. "A movie from certain country will reflect its national ideology," Alison says, "it’s just a matter of degree."</p>

            <p>From Ray’s perspective, politics also affects movie on personal level, as he illustrates, "if actor/actress has extreme words and deeds, my interest in movie itself will surely fall". He thinks every movie could be full of ideology, if audiences just keep thinking and deducing, but "it’s totally fine as long as you are comfortable with it".</p>

            <p>Simon thinks personal attitudes and stereotypes in movies are inevitable, because "produces, reviewers, audiences – they are all people and only people". However, Tom argues "every producer should pay attention to his/her social responsibility, and should not impose own thoughts on people".</p>

            <p>While believing that "cultural production is usually manipulated", May does not think it is appropriate to propagate ideology with movie. As she describes, ideally, "a movie could be a simple story that audiences can taste every bite of emotions in it. It’s not movie’s function to impose thinking." </p>

            <p>"I just want to watch a pure story, whether it is about love, humour or suspense, and that’s all." Says May.</p>

            <h4>Censorship and rating system?</h4>

            <p>Though there are some comments using words like "too excessive" and "too strict", most of interviewees actually support film censorship conducted by SARFT.</p>

            <p>Doug says he hates SARFT, but "what it does is necessary". In order to build a harmonious society, "I guess we can sacrifice some movies". Also, right now SARFT only decides which movies shall pass the censorship, instead of giving them different ratings, and this upsets him, but "the state owns the discourse power, so don’t ask why in China." </p>

            <p>Ray holds similar opinion with Doug, that "if movies with reactionary theme are released, they are going to smash the harmony in China." Tom also support censorship in the sense that "not all creations are appropriate for viewing, therefore SARFT takes account for supervision". However, he agrees that all restrictions "make it harder to shoot a film in China than in other countries".</p>

            <p>Simon regards film censorship as necessary, and thinks some generally acknowledged rules are proper to be adopted, however, "if personal preferences are also considered in censorship, it is nonsense. Because it’s your own opinion, not everyone’s". He adds that, "it’s also nonsense to think about so many political issues when screen, because it reflects the fragility of our government".</p>

            <p>Molly thinks discussion on film censorship is needed, and raises questions as "who made the rules for censorship" and "why it has to be so". For years, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp2cNQDKi1w" target="_blank">rules and standards are vague and largely depend on rule makers’ personal judgment</a>.</p>

            <p>Speaking of rating system, the majority shows absolute support for it. Molly is surprised by the fact that there exists no such system yet – "So Chinese children could actually watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/" target="_blank">A Clockwork Orange</a> in theatre?" Meanwhile, some think it is also fine to live without it.</p>

            <p>Mia illustrates that "by now domestic and imported movies are under SARFT’s supervision, so there should not be many problems with them. We don’t have many choices for movies, and those released are usually just mediocre, so it might be meaningless to rate them". Ray agrees with her, that "if a movie has past through censorship, it’s fine for everyone to watch, because the censorship is highly strict."</p>

            <p>Tom finds it very necessary to build a rating system, but "policies cannot be made within one day, but it needs support from masses". He thinks that Chinese used to watch movies all together, whether old or young, male or female, so "now we have to make baby steps changing the habit". </p>

            <p>Simon also talks about the necessity and difficulty for rating system in China, "because the population is huge, and people live in various social classes with different educational backgrounds. However, no matter how hard it is, at least you should make a move".</p>

            <p>May raises an example of movies with bloody scenes, these movies are not appropriate for children, but adults should have the right to watch them. "Some adults might just like those kind of movies, and I cannot see a reason to suppress that." She thinks that, not like children who have to be protected by parents, adults are reasonable enough to make their own decisions.</p>

            <p>Because it would be hard to make sure that everyone follows the rating system, she also brings up an idea, that we could divide theatre into different sorts, such as theatres showing adult movies, theatres showing child movies, and theatres showing general movies as well. </p>

            <h4>What about domestic movies?</h4>

            <p>Though some interviewees think themselves as domestic movie supporters, all of them have recommended foreign movies when asked. </p>

            <p>The mentioned movies are: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1318514/" target="_blank"> Rise of the Planet of the Apes</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3040964/" target="_blank">The Jungle Book</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/" target="_blank">The Dark Knight</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/" target="_blank">Avatar</a> , <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2106476/" target="_blank">The Hunt</a> , <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/" target="_blank">Coherence</a, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4901306/" target="_blank">Perfect Strangers</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179025/" target="_blank">The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079833/" target="_blank">The The Castle of Cagliostro</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/" target="_blank">Snowpiercer</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1069238/" target="_blank">Departures</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/" target="_blank">Brokeback Mountain</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/" target="_blank">Trainspotting</a>.</p>

            <p>For all recommended movies, seven of them are from Hollywood, while Japanese movies take two positions. Though Hollywood movies own mighty impact around the world, Japanese movies also stand out, maybe because of the similar cultural background. Mia says she mostly watch Asian movies, "especially movies from China, Japan and Korea".</p>

            <p>According to Doug, Hollywood action movies are usually good, while domestic comedies have "more Chinese elements" and are related to his cultural background, so they seem funnier for him. </p>

            <p>Simon says "domestic comedies do get me, but recent ones are not so attractive". He likes Xiaogang Feng for he is interesting and "down-to-earth", and his favourite comedy is A World Without Thieves, while Yimou Zhang’s movies have "already turned into a flamboyant style".</p>

            <p>Tom and May holds an opinion that domestic comedies are not that good, especially the recent ones. As for action movies, Tom adds, "I think only Once Upon a Time in China can be called a good action film", and he thinks Hollywood action movies always promote individualistic heroism, and their roles do not have enough emotions.</p>

            <p>Alison calls herself a forced domestic movie supporter, because under SARFT’s control, "right now is the domestic film protection month, so anything in front of you is made in China". For Molly, who lives in London, domestic movies are not so easy to reach, nor does she desire to watch them - "I cannot think of any genre that domestic movies are good at".</p>

            <p>Mia feels the same with Alison: "Usually a Hollywood movie at least has good tableau, and it is worthy of my money, not like some domestic ones. I can understand that the government wants to promote domestic movies, but still I’d like to see more good foreign movies."</p>

            <p>One problem with domestic movies, as Doug illustrates, is that movies’ possible themes have been reduced to a small range - "Many of them focus on ancient rather than contemporary stories such as Journey to the West, still, they are reflecting politics and culture." </p>

            <p>While Doug blames it on censorship, Tom thinks it is producers and directors’ fault: "There are actually many themes and stories to be discovered in the long history of China, however, not enough directors are cultured enough to do that, instead Hollywood has borrowed a lot from Chinese and Japanese culture."</p>

            <p>Molly also mentions movie’s function for exporting cultures, and she does not regard Chinese movies as successful in this aspect: "So far, there are few products related to culture have been released, or you can say, they don’t look attractive enough."</p>

            <h4>Opinions on Chinese market?</h4>

            <p>"There is strength in numbers." Mia concludes on this issue, that "after all we have near 1.4 billion people, so the box office must be huge".</p>

            <p>Doug, however, treats population base as only one of the reasons, and there are another two: "first, more movies have been imported, as entertainment industry is developing fast. Second, living standard is rising, as Maslow's hierarchy of needs implies, food is before spiritual enjoyment."</p>

            <p>From 2012 till now, 34 foreign movies are able to be imported each year, while the <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/china-film-import-quota-increase-696708" target="_blank">restriction could be abolished in 2017-2018</a>. </p>

            <p>Doug believes that the number of movie audiences in China will continue growing, because of "quick urbanisation". Relative techniques and commercial modes have helped Chinese movie industry’s development as well, such as mobile application and group purchase.</p>

            <p>Alison thinks the prosperity of movie market reflects citizens’ spiritual emptiness. "Frankly speaking, we don’t have many forms of entertainment," says she, "the most popular recreation ways for masses are still Karaoke and movies." May feels more positive, and she thinks this shows people are willing to consume on entertainment: "I think people also enjoyed watching movie when the economy is not as developed as now, like watching outdoors with comrades, and it proves that we really care about entertaining."</p>

            <p>No one seems to be surprised at Chinese movie market’s rapid development, however, no one seems to be really happy about this either.</p>

            <p>A concern is that, with the fast expanding of market, lousy movies are emerging with incredible speed as well. </p>

            <p>"Now that movie is a part of life, and Chinese theatres have reached the highest number in the world, certainly there is profitability", says Tom. While more and more people are trying their luck in this gold rush, He does not think everyone could make it – after all, movie is high art. </p>

            <p>However, Chinese filmmakers have found an effective way to make money, that they focus on promoting instead of making movies. Tom illustrates, "it’s usual for a domestic movie to win box office based on hideousness, and audiences are just doing them a favour when ridiculing on social networks". </p>

            <p>The <a href="http://trekwho.github.io/hereiam/movie/top100" target="_blank">100 highest grossing films list</a> could also be an evidence, as 19 out of all listed 52 domestic films have rating scores lower than 6/10.</p>

            <p>Molly sees prosperous market as an opportunity for Chinese movies, but she does not think this promises a bright future for domestic movies: "Profits speak louder. Though plenty of money has been spent on movie, it may largely be used to chase famous actors/actresses, while the production remains lousy."</a>

            <p>When asked about his opinion on Chinese movie industry, Simon says "I just hope more great movies can be produced, and I have nothing left to wish for".</p>

For example, when I’m free at weekend, I’ll watch a movie’s premiere at 12 am. <strong>I would not like to watch a movie at early evening, because it wastes my precious time</strong>. Another good time for me is the morning of weekend, for instance, I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/" target="_blank">Captain America: Civil War</a> at 8 am, because the price is much cheaper by then. Also, movie is a good company for eating alone. If specific themed movies that interest me, I’ll go watch them. They usually have good reputation, and you can talk about them with others. However, <strong>I watch less and less movie after I bought Kindle</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q4').html('<div id="q4">I mainly choose a movie based on its genre, and the cast. I’m not a fan of action movies, and I only watch them on TV. Instead, <strong>animation and art movies are my favourites, even if they are not so popular</strong>. For cast, I definitely would not watch a movie with eye candies such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2854802/" target="_blank">Angelababy</a>. What else … I will also look at reviews, and consider watching some movies with good reputation.</div>');
            $('#q5').html('<div id="q5">No. Maybe I have watched this during military training, but <strong>certainly not because I want to</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q6').html('<div id="q6"><strong>Mostly from Japan, and then domestic movies</strong>. Because I often watch animation movies out of interest, then there are Hollywood blockbusters. If several interested movies are released altogether, I’ll make decision based on the specific situation and time. For example, when I visit theatre alone, I may choose arts film like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4613272/" target="_blank">Kaili Blues (Lu Bian Ye Can)</a>, <strong>because I’m not sure if my friends want to watch it, when we go to the theatre together</strong>.</div>');

Seat limit, other people around, wide screen, great audio effects, all these make up an atmosphere, which is just different.

And <strong>I won’t bear grudge</strong>, as long as him/her does not go too extreme. However, <strong>if the person involved is an absolute idiot, I might tend to think he/she cannot make good movies</strong>. But this is definitely not for sure, as I personally hate ultra-leftists, but they may still produce great movies.</div>');
            $('#q12').html('<div id="q12"><strong>Produces, reviewers, audiences – they are all people and only people</strong>, so they must have personal attitudes and stereotypes. It’s just that movies often try to conceal their ideologies, and hide all kinds of political metaphors, but it could be hard for sci-fi or utopian movies. I think movie awards are also affected by political standings.</div>');

Some generally acknowledged rules are proper, such as children are not supposed to watch erotic and violence scenes, and theatre should not show movies with discrimination. However, <strong>if personal preferences are also considered in censorship, it is nonsense</strong>. Because it’s your own opinion, not everyone’s. It’s also nonsense to think about so many political issues when screen, because it reflects the fragility of our government.</div>');
            $('#q14').html('<div id="q14">It is necessary, but it is also difficult in China. Because the population is huge, and people live in various social classes with different educational backgrounds. However, <strong>no matter how hard it is, at least you should make a move</strong>. It makes no sense that, because it’s hard to do, then you give up at the very beginning.</div>');
            $('#q15').html('<div id="q15">My first reaction is, congratulations. We have so many people, and now we have money, so we surpass others on lots of aspects. <strong>But to think deeply, does this mean movie industry will rise in China</strong> Will more industrial parks be built? And how could this affect me? By now, all these things still seem faraway. <strong>I just hope more great movies can be produced, and I have nothing left to wish for</strong>.</div>');

The only director I follow is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/" target="_blank">Quentin Tarantino</a>, and he is just my cup of tea. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0464804/" target="_blank">Satoshi Kon</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/" target="_blank">Hayao Miyazaki</a> are also great. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0271815/" target="_blank">Xiaogang Feng</a> is actually good, because he is interesting, and he is always down-to-earth, I especially like his <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439884/" target="_blank">A World Without Thieves</a>, while <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955443/" target="_blank">Yimou Zhang</a> has already turned into a flamboyant style. One movie I really really really really love is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1069238/" target="_blank">Departures</a>, and <strong>I think everyone should watch it</strong>. Though there were only few movies talking about life and death, and philosophical questions such as ‘who am I’ and ‘where am I going’, it would be divine once a great movie came out.</div>');

And I’ll take production into account, for example, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4057376/" target=“_blank”>On – Drakon</a> failed on story, but it still has pretty pictures to look at.</div>');

For another example, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0864779/" target="_blank">Chapman To</a> is not friendly towards mainland, and neither do we like him, so you would not watch a movie with him, because of public opinions’ influence.</div>');

            $('#q13').html('<div id="q13">It is necessary indeed, but right now it’s just too strict. I’ll vote for a rating system. But by now, <strong>more deliberations are needed on China’s current condition</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q14').html('<div id="q14">Yes! Because some movies cannot be imported unless there is a rating system. Right now, I have to watch them in Hong Kong. <strong>People have this demand, and it may affect the state’s decision</strong>, but we don’t know when. I’m not yet considering having children, so I do not have clear standards by now, but I won’t let my kids watch movies with nudity, that’s for sure. Cartoons are more appropriate.</div>');
            $('#q15').html('<div id="q15">When I think about it, I think there are two reasons: <strong>population base</strong>, and <strong>spiritual emptiness</strong>. Frankly speaking, we don’t have many forms of entertainment. Though some games, like hiking, are rising, the most popular recreation ways for masses are still Karaoke and movies.</div>');
            $('#q16').html('<div id="q16">For me, no specific casts. Because I think if you like some directors, you’ve got to watch their works throughout the years and study their styles, but I’m not that kind of person. As you can see, when promoting a movie, marketers often focus on celebrities in cast, or how much does the movie cost, or how long does it take to make it, while only few talk about directors. I have no preference over actors or actresses as well. A movie really impressed me is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/" target=“_blank”>Snowpiercer</a>. Usually, a Hollywood action movie is full of fighting scenes with monsters, but this one is about people making hard decision in extreme environments. It is also a representation of society, and that makes you feel a bit depressed.</div>');

Korean movies own handsome actors and sometimes meaningful themes, and I think they are awesome. As for Hollywood movies, I prefer superhero ones with plenty of visual effects, even though they are <strong>somewhat mindless</strong>. If a Chinese drama is released at the same time with a Hollywood superhero movie, I probably would watch the latter one first, <strong>unless the drama has great reputation</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q7').html('<div id="q7"><strong>Maybe 10 to 15 per month</strong>. And 3 or 4 movies in theatre every month. But it goes with movies’ schedule, as <strong>I might watch none if all movies released are awful</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q8').html('<div id="q8">Generally, I watch most during <strong>summer and new year holidays</strong>, but it’s not because of my personal schedule, as I’m not working yet and have much free time.

            $('#q9').html('<div id="q9">No, just the other day I have watched a good domestic action movie on TV. <strong>I won’t judge a movie simply by stereotype or tag</strong>, instead it has to be viewed specifically. Indeed, there are more mindless Hollywood movies in theatre, but it is <strong>what we have observed shapes our value system</strong>, and it might be a governmental action for brainwashing. After all, it is SARFT that decides what movies can be public released in China, and <strong>to be honest SARFT is a little bitchy</strong>. Usually a Hollywood movie at least has good tableau, and it is worthy of my money, not like some domestic ones. I can understand that the government wants to promote domestic movies, but still I’d like to see more good foreign movies.</div>');
            $('#q10').html('<div id="q10">Sometimes you have to watch movies in theatre for visual effects, as it is more thrilling, and sometimes only watching with other people <strong>brings you the right feeling and atmosphere</strong>. By now I have little experience of VR, but I think <strong>theatre may also upgrade its techniques</strong> and develop with time.</div>');
            $('#q11').html('<div id="q11">As a qualified member of the communist party, I have to say <strong>I would not watch a movie with different political opinions</strong>. However, I will only express my feeling to family, and leave others alone. For the recent incident of No Other Love, I think <strong>netizens are getting too hot-headed</strong>, but from another perspective, it might be SARFT’s intention to handle public opinion.</div>');
            $('#q12').html('<div id="q12">Every superhero movie reflects American ideology, but it’s not necessary the case with domestic movies – some of them are not even capable of being called ‘movie’, not to mention reflecting ideology. It’s pretty natural for Hollywood movies to promote capitalism, as producers being raised with that kind of thinking. There is no need to change that, and it is not able to change as well. <strong>It would be boring if all movies carry the same value system</strong>. China has to be <strong>economically developed before trying to export values</strong>, or it would only be in derision. Maybe one day, others will find the merits in ‘mysterious Eastern power’.</div>');
            $('#q13').html('<div id="q13">All those <strong>censorship methods are too excessive</strong>. Instead of deleting scenes, <strong>rating is more appropriate</strong>. Especially for imported movies, deleting might lead to misunderstanding.</div>');
            $('#q14').html('<div id="q14"><strong>Of course there should be a rating system</strong>. Some movies are good in general, but also with many violence scenes that are not appropriate for children. Without rating system, I have no idea how to stop my children watching, and that’s awkward. By now <strong>domestic and imported movies are under SARFT’s supervision</strong>, so there should not be many problems with them. We don’t have many choices for movies, and those released are usually usually just mediocre, so <strong>it might be meaningless to rate them</strong>. Also, production companies are not willing to reduce possible audiences and profits, but mainly it’s SARFT’s call on this issue. It’s <strong>good to have non-governmental rating systems</strong>, as you can have your own value system without the state’s guide.</div>');

            $('#q7').html('<div id="q7">Like 2 movies a week? I’m not sure. As in theatre, I might only watch 1 movie per month. Because for me there are less and less movies with attractive theme and story, so I mostly just watch old ones online, and by now I have watched pretty much everything.</div>');
            $('#q8').html('<div id="q8"><strong>New year and summer time</strong>. As in these two periods, many new movies will be on, especially in the end of a year, there are plenty of new year comedies.</div>');
            $('#q9').html('<div id="q9">Yeah I kind of agree. <strong>Hollywood knows how to make action movies</strong>, as for comedy, I cannot say which are better, but <strong>domestic comedies have more Chinese elements with cultural background</strong>, so they are funnier. In daily life I watch British and American TV series but I won’t watch their comedies.</div>');
            $('#q10').html('<div id="q10">Of course it is necessary. After all, it is a <strong>public space with special atmosphere</strong>. Just like watching football games, even though you can watch it on TV, lots of people go to the arena, because <strong>it’s the feeling that matters</strong>. Theatre combines effects with atmosphere, so that it is irreplaceable, though home theatre rises. Also theatre is developing new techniques such as 4D and even 5D. <strong>So at least in recent decades, people still will go to theatre for movie</strong>. It might even have more and more audiences in China, because of <strong>quick urbanisation</strong>. Group purchase helps Chinese movie industry’s development as well. I think theatres have to compete violently against each other, but all in all they will survive.</div>');
            $('#q11').html('<div id="q11">In my opinion, <strong>movie should be independent from politics</strong>. It’s just that this issue is very sensitive in China, therefore <strong>public figures have to pay extra attention to their behaviours</strong>. In places like China, where has serious political atmosphere, movie relating to Taiwan issue might lead to public condemnation, but I think it’s not appropriate to kidnap movie with politics.</div>');
            $('#q12').html('<div id="q12">Lots of movies do. But <strong>maybe it’s not that obvious with Chinese movies</strong>, for example, many of them focus on ancient rather than contemporary stories such as Journey to the West, still, they are reflecting politics and culture. I think <strong>it’s normal that producers have their own judgment and feelings in works</strong>, so that different movies can be made out of the same story, and I support that. I am quite open with movie, that <strong>I can tell the difference between movie and reality</strong>, and I won’t give up on a movie simply because its producers or casts are related to political issues.</div>');
            $('#q13').html('<div id="q13">Yeah it’s necessary, for brainwashing. In China, if movies have plots instigating mass against the state, exaggeratedly speaking, it can lead people astray. <strong>Though I hate SARFT, what it does is necessary</strong>. It aims at building a harmonious society, and that accords with Chinese value system, so <strong>I guess we can sacrifice some movies</strong> for that. Censorship may be changed in the future, but will still exist. Western countries have their censoring systems as well, mainly for violence and erotic scenes, it’s just <strong>stricter in China, such as elements related to politics</strong>. Because socialism counties generally have only one party, and it has to maintain its absolute power, so masses are not allowed to hear different political opinions publicly.</div>');
            $('#q14').html('<div id="q14">It’s only a question of passing or not passing, and there’s no rating system. But it’s necessary. For now, <strong>the state owns the discourse power, so don’t ask why in China</strong>. I support non-governmental rating system, as the law is silent on this point. I think individual or non-government organisations could make recommendation on specific movies.</div>');
            $('#q15').html('<div id="q15">It’s pretty normal, as there are three reasons for this situation: 1) more movies have been imported, as <strong>entertainment industry is developing fas</strong>. 2) <strong>living standard is rising</strong>, as Maslow’s hierarchy of needs implies, food is before spiritual enjoyment. 3) population base, China should be no.1 sooner.

There is no guarantee with the cast, as <strong>even the greatest actor in the world could produce bad movies</strong>.

If you ask me, I prefer watching action or sci-fi movies in theatre and drama at home, but it’s hard to watch comedy alone.

As for this example, I think the movie’s possible profits will decrease, if audiences refuse to watch it out of patriotisms.

            $('#q12').html('<div id="q12">It depends on how you appreciate a movie. To be honest, <strong>if you keep thinking and deducing, every movie could be full of ideology</strong>. But it’s also okay to simply appreciate a movie’s arts. Some movies own strong political metaphors, like some Hollywood movies will show reflections of China’s situation, and that’s not so good. If a movie is just promoting some spirits, and is not related to the national interest, then it’s totally fine <strong>as long as you are comfortable with it</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q13').html('<div id="q13">It is necessary. Because <strong>if movies with reactionary theme are released, they are going to smash the harmony in China</strong>.

            $('#q3').html('<div id="q3">Quite important. For example, you can watch a whole movie during or after dinner. Movie is a great method for gaining knowledge, because it is <strong>straightforward and with lots of details</strong>. You can learn about historical events and foreign cultures, as well as the pace of social development. People also put their ideas and feelings inside movies, and <strong>express themselves through movies</strong>. Some Indian audiences cheer up for movies like they are watching a game, because their daily lives are dull compared to movies, and they get really happy when good guy defeats bad buy in movie. Besides, <strong>movie can explore the new frontier of human mind</strong>, for instance, it usually takes longer to realise a scientific breakthrough than to make hypotheses in a movie.</div>');
            $('#q4').html('<div id="q4"><strong>The key point is the details</strong>. For example, many Russian and American movies have made vivid representations of the original history, that even a utility cast member wears the right clothes, while Chinese movies are full of absurd goofs. <strong>If you cannot make good appearances, I won’t trust on your inner beauty</strong>. I think Hollywood actors significantly beat Chinese ones on acting with dialects and accents. For me, it doesn’t matter if a movie has stars in its cast, as long as they don’t look ugly, I’m satisfied.</div>');
            $('#q5').html('<div id="q5">Yes I will. Not because of those celebrities, but <Strong>I want to know the ideology of our country</strong>. Does it make objective judgment? Has it done enough research on the related history? Are the costumes appropriate? Things like that.</div>');

For domestic movies, I only watch lousy ones, like<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1224152/" target=“_blank”>Sherlock Holmes in China</a>.

            $('#q9').html('<div id="q9">No! Domestic comedies are not very good. <strong>Hollywood makes great superhero movies, but their action movies usually have simple frames</strong>, that all of them are promoting individualistic heroism and roles do not have enough emotions. I think only <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103285/" target=“_blank”>Once Upon a Time in China</a> can be called a good action film.</div>');
            $('#q10').html('<div id="q10">Yes. Watching movie is a way of relaxation, as you can see, elderly people drink tea and chat under the sun, while youth go to theatre constantly.

            $('#q11').html('<div id="q11">Oh I have liked that actor for long time. I think <strong>a movie has nothing to do with its casts’ political standings</strong>, instead the story and acting skills are more important. Though I know Hollywood movies often make presumptuous speculation on China. Also, <strong>I would rather die than watch domestic main-melody movies</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q12').html('<div id="q12">Yeah that’s for sure. <strong>Movie is a part of life, while politics is a significant part of life</strong>. Some movies are made to be producers’ emotional outlet, but they could lead astray the minds of ignorant masses. I think every <Strong>producer should pay attention to his/her social responsibility</strong>, and should not impose own thoughts on people, and thereby disturbing social order.</div>');
            $('#q13').html('<div id="q13">It is necessary, and there is also censorship in other countries like Japan. Movies propagating doomsday concept or violence have bad influence on audiences. <strong>Not all creations are appropriate for viewing</strong>, therefore SARFT takes account for supervision. Actually, rating system should be introduced, because it’s difficult to produce movies suitable for all ages. <strong>All those restrictions make it harder to shoot a film in China than in other countries</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q14').html('<div id="q14">Very necessary. Adolescents are not mature enough, for example, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5269560/" target=“_blank”>Ten Years</a> made in Hong Kong, this movie has encouraged many youths to parade on the street, so it’s totally creating insecurity. However, <strong>policies cannot be made within one day, but it needs support from masses</strong>. We used to watch movies all together, whether old or young, male or female, so now we have to make baby steps changing the habit. Bottom up, then top down, combine to make a balance.</div>');
            $('#q15').html('<div id="q15">That’s because our life standard has risen. Now that movie is a part of life, and Chinese theatres have reached the highest number in the world, certainly there is profitability. Meanwhile, lots of lousy movies have been made. <strong>I don’t think everyone could make movies, because it is high art. But now in China, filmmakers focus on promoting instead of making movies</strong>. It’s usual for a domestic movie to win box office based on hideousness, and audiences are just doing them a favour when ridiculing on social networks. There are actually many themes and stories to be discovered in the long history of China, however, not enough directors are cultured enough to do that, instead Hollywood has borrowed a lot from Chinese and Japanese culture.</div>');
            $('#q16').html('<div id="q16">Actors from old Hong Kong movies, such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628806/" target=“_blank”>Man-Tat Ng</a> (aka Mengda Wu), <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0401201/" target=“_blank”>Michael Hui</a> (aka Guanwen Xu) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0401207/" target=“_blank”>Samuel Hui</a> (aka Guanjie Xu). I also like many Japanese stars, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757007/" target=“_blank>Masato Sakai</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0298048/" target=“_blank”>Masaharu Fukuyama</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0619178/" target=“_blank”>Masami Nagasawa</a>.

For movie, I recommend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079833/" target=“_blank”>The Castle of Cagliostro</a> by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/" target=“_blank”>Hayao Miyazaki</a>.</div>');

            $('#q3').html('<div id="q3">It’s <strong>an important activity for relaxation</strong>, because I don’t have much to do in spare time. Also, movie helps release pressures and improve mood.</div>');
            $('#q4').html('<div id="q4">Mostly, I choose a movie based on its theme, but also I might get affected by its genre imperceptably. Then there are <strong>movie stars, for whom I will focus on their acting skills</strong>. For example, I used to like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1089991/" target=“_blank”>Tom Hiddleston</a>, but I really do not want to watch his movies in the future, unless he only plays a small role like in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/" target=“_blank”>The Avengers</a>. It’s not important for me whether a movie has spectacles or not, while its <strong>background story could attract me</strong>, but then if it has bad reputation, I will not watch it. For instance, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1920885/" target=“_blank”>Big Fish & Begonia</a> takes twelve years to produce, and I would like to watch it, but then I heard it’s not that good and I gave up.</div>');
            $('#q5').html('<div id="q5">I have watched it, although I did not want to. However, there are so many celebrities in it, and <strong>everybody is talking about this movie, so you have to keep pace</strong>. When watching it, I think audiences just neglect the plot and instead focusing on counting which stars appear at what time.</div>');
            $('#q6').html('<div id="q6">Definitely Hollywood movies, because, <strong>obviously, there are more movies being produced there</strong>. I live in London, and movies released here are basically made in Hollywood. Then domestic movies? Maybe not. But I have watched a domestic movie here.

            $('#q7').html('<div id="q7">This month I did not watch any because I’m busy, but <strong>sometimes I watch outrageously</strong>. On average, I watch 2 movies per week. As for theatre, I might watch 1 or 2 movie a month.</div>');
            $('#q8').html('<div id="q8">During holidays, because I’ll be free by then. However, <strong>I also watch lots of movies during semester</strong>, because I feel like to relax myself after a tough day of studying.</div>');
            $('#q9').html('<div id="q9"><strong>I cannot think of any genre that domestic movies are good at</strong>. Hollywood does specialise in action movies, because you know, I think other genres like art movies are usually made in France, instead of Hollywood.</div>');
            $('#q10').html('<div id="q10">I think people are supposed to visit theatre in daily life, because <strong>you have to support movies with copyrights</strong>, and box office is a way to show your support. Also, theatre is a fantastic place for dating, and stuffs as premieres are really fun. It is totally different from watching at home, because your emotions are stimulated by other audiences. I’m pretty confident in theatre in the future, because this is a solid entertainment industry, especially in China, consumers’ attitudes are more open and they will go to theatre more often. In return, <strong>theatres have more gimmicks for promoting</strong>, such as doing cosplay on premiere.</div>');
            $('#q11').html('<div id="q11">Maybe it affects me a little. After all, I have low interest in watching a domestic movie, and <strong>it gets even lower with so many scandals</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q12').html('<div id="q12">I agree. Movie does have a function for exporting cultures, because initially it is cultural production, and this happens in every country. However, <Strong>Chinese movies are not successful in this aspect</strong>, and so far there are few products related to culture have been released, or you can say, they don’t look attractive enough. I think one option is that Chinese capitals invest in Hollywood, for example, many Chinese elements appear in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3110958/" target=“_blank”>Now You See Me 2</a>, and this used to cause rejection, but this one does fine.</div>');
            $('#q13').html('<div id="q13">Censorship is necessary, but sometimes it goes too far. I think <strong>we need to discuss about this topic</strong>, such as who made the rules for censorship, and why it has to be so.</div>');
            $('#q14').html('<div id="q14">Of course it is necessary. <Strong>So you are telling me our country does not have it? So Chinese children could actually watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/" target=“_blank”>A Clockwork Orange</a> in theatre</strong>? But maybe there is no such movie being released in Chinese theatres in the first place. Since no official rating system exists, I think theatre has to mention the inappropriate content in movies and suggest audiences choosing proper ones. Or, you can always ask children to leave if they cannot stand it.</div>');
            $('#q15').html('<div id="q15">Because population is relatively huge, and movie is quite important to us. This could have positive effects on Chinese movies, that more companies will invest in producing movies. However, this might also lead to more bad movies, because profits speak louder. Though plenty of money has been spent on movie, it may largely be used to chase famous actors/actresses, while the production remains lousy. So <Strong>I don’t think prosperous market equals to a bright future for domestic movies</strong>.</div>');
            $('#q16').html('<div id="q16">I generally prefer actors/actresses with good acting skills, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564215/" target=“_blank”>James McAvoy</a>. For directors, I’m a fan of Oscar nominees, such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0634240/" target=“_blank”>Christopher Nolan</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/" target=“_blank”>David Fincher</a>, < a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/" target=“_blank”>Quentin Tarantino</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000487/" target=“_blank”>Ang Lee</a>, because first, their movies are more or less accountable, second, they have <strong>strong personal styles</strong>. When you are looking for some specific type of movies, you will think of them immediately. My favourite is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000487/ " target=“_blank”>Ang Lee</a>, because he keeps making movies of various themes with innovation, but also keeps his personal style, and his movies usually have good stories and high qualities. I recommend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388795/" target=“_blank”>Brokeback Mountain</a>, oh, I have to give reasons? Then I shall recommend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/" target=“_blank”>Trainspotting</a>, because this is a movie with meaning yet without meaning at all, and it just loyally describes the life of decadents, and audiences are therefore able to bring in their own meanings freely.</div>');
